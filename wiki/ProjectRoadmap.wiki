#summary Things remaining to do
#labels roadmap

 *  Unit tests grid based localization

 *  Devise a mechanism whereby the mapping service can ask the odometry server for data, such as "what was my best pose estimate at time t".

 *  Odometry fusion.  Odometry offsets need to be applied relative to the current or estimated pose.

 *  Simulation unit tests for odometry fusion - prove that pose error remains stable.

 *  Data gathering runs in a real environment (not simulation).  Collect wheel and visual odometry data, which may be used for simulation tests.

 *  Localizing runs in a real environment, using MCL, or similar.

 *  Devise a front end to make using the robot easier.  This might be GWT based (used through a browser) or could be basd on GTK/Winforms.  A web based system would be preferable, although has limitations in terms of the kinds of visualizations possible.

 *  Create a web site for GROK2, and upload testing data so that the results may be independently analyzed/reproduced (trying to make robotics a real science!).
