*More multicore features*

  *  Try parallelizing stereo correspondence (in the dense algorithm each row is processed separately, so in principle this is an easy algorithm to parallelize).

*Grid mapping as a service*

  *  Something similar to the bridgeware framework should be used to make 3D grid mapping into a service based on TCP/XML.  Potentially multiple grids could be processed separately on different computers, or in "the cloud".

*Gather data*

Most of the infrastructure - including a physical robot - is in place and gathering of real data sets including stereo images, wheel odometry and ultrasonics data is now a realistic prospect.  Creation of data sets in domestic scenarios should begin in early 2009.

*Investigate possible simulation environments*

A good way to visualize the movement of the robot and also the 3D occupancy data still remains to be found.  There are off the shelf robot simulators, but these all seem to assume that objects in the environment are known with complete certainty - which is obviously unrealistic.  It may end up that I just have to write a dedicated program for this, although I'd prefer to use something off-the-shelf if possible.

*Dream sequences, or simulation by playing back recorded sensor data*

Investigate the possibility of "playing back" recorded sensor data and images as a means of simulation and unit testing the higher level systems.

*SLAM*

Further refinement of the DP-SLAM algorithm, and possible testing of alternative SLAM methods.
