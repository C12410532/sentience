fswebcam is a good utility which works with Video4Linux version 1 and 2 devices.  I've also used it with the so-called "driverless" USB Video class (UVC) devices.  The main site for this utility [http://www.firestorm.cx/fswebcam/ is here].  There is a problem associated with using fswebcam for stereo vision though, in that it's not intended to capture images from more than a single camera device at a time.  As a workaround for this I modified the 20070108 version of fswebcam to be able to grab images from different devices in quick succession.  The modified version, which includes all the original functionality, [http://code.google.com/p/sentience/source/browse/#svn/trunk/applications/fswebcam can be found here].

To install the modified version on an Ubuntu system first you will need to [http://www.libgd.org download the GD library] upon which it is based.  Move to the directory where you extracted the code, then go though the usual installation sequence:

{{{
./configure
make
sudo make install
}}}

Download the [http://code.google.com/p/sentience/source/browse/trunk/applications/fswebcam-20080912.tar.gz modified version of fswebcam] and go through the same install procedure.  You will now be able to use the utility with multiple devices, like this:

{{{
fswebcam -S 2 -d /dev/video0,/dev/video1 -r 320x240 --no-banner -save test.jpg
}}}

This will save two images called test0.jpg and test1.jpg.  You can even capture from more than two camera devices if you wish, with the main limit being USB bandwidth.
