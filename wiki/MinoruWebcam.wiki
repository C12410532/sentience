= Introduction =

The Minoru is the first commercially available stereo webcam.  It's primarily intended for entertainment - broadcasting stereo anaglyphs as a novel alternative to the usual webcam based video conferencing or blogging.  However, it also makes a good inexpensive range sensor for robotics use.

= Disassembly =

The Minoru comes in a casing which is attractive, but not very easy to mount onto a flat surface.  The outer casing can be removed as follows:

  # Remove the camera stand using a hacksaw just beneath the main body of the camera.
  # The silver band around the centre of the camera can then be removed in two sections.
  # Using a knife or precision screwdriver carefully separate the two halves of the casing.  This can be quite tricky.
  # Remove the white plastic lens covers and any surrounding foam.
  # You may wish to remove the rubber backing, or keep it in place to insulate the electronics from the surface upon which you're mounting the camera.
  # Finally you should have extracted the camera board, which looks like the picture above.

= Software = 

The Minoru is UVC compilant, and therefore very easy to use on a GNU/Linux operating system.  Plug in the camera, then open a command shell and type:

{{{
ls /dev/video*
}}}

This should display two extra video devices.  If you are using a kernel with a version earlier than 2.6.30, obtain the latest UVC driver from [http://linuxtv.org/hg/~pinchartl/uvcvideo here] then install it (possibly you might need to reboot for the new driver to take effect).

You can test out the webcam using a program called *v4l2stereo*, which is part of a project called [http://code.google.com/p/libv4l2cam/ libv4l2cam] which is related to the Sentience project, and is also under the General Public License.  A [http://code.google.com/p/libv4l2cam/source/browse/trunk/v4l2stereo/v4l2stereo.deb deb package] is available for easy installation on Debian based distros.  If you wish to compile from the source code, first download and [http://dircweb.king.ac.uk/reason/opencv_cvs.php install opencv].

_v4l2stereo_ can be used in various ways, but to check that the Minoru is working you can use the following command.

{{{
v4l2stereo -0 /dev/video1 -1 /dev/video0 --features
}}}

This assumes that the left camera is video device number 1 and the right camera is video device number 0, and should display two images showing the edge features which are the basis for stereo matching.
