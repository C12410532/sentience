#summary Matching two images together
#labels correspondence

Stereo correspondence is the problem of discovering the closest possible match between two images captured symultaneously from cameras in different spatial locations.  Typically the cameras are alligned in such a way that each [ScanLine scan line] of the [ImageRectification rectified] images corresponds to the same line in the opposite image - something known as the [EpipolarConstraint epipolar constraint].

It should be noted that solving the stereo correspondence problem unde the epipolar constraint is a special class of a more general problem domain.  Near identical methods may be used to solve the problem of matching two images taken from the same camera but separated by some small difference in time as the robot moves through space (structure from motion).  It may also be used to _stitch_ or _register_ images together to form larger panoramas, maps, or synchronise deformable models.  The ideal stereo correspondence algorithm therefore would be a specialised subclass of this very general matching solution.
