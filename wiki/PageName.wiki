Camera images normally contain some amount of spherical distortion, sometimes known as the _goldfish bowl effect_.  Linear features such as chair legs or door frames may appear to be warped, especially at the periphery of the image.  The job of camera calibration is to undistort the image, such that straight lines in the real world correspond to straight lines within the image.

Various methods of calibration exist.  The simplest method assumes a perfectly symmetrical lens around the [centre of distortion], and uses an equation to represent how light rays are bent radially around this by the curvature of the lens.  [http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ajd/ Andrew Davison] used this for single camera [SLAM], and for most practical purposes it works ok.  However, it should be noted that in practice few camera lenses are perfectly symmetrical.
